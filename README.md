**With this code and the associated articles, you are going to:**
- Create a neural network from scratch in Python. Train it using the gradient descent algorithm.
- Apply that basic network to The Wisconsin Cancer Data-set. Predict if a tumor is benign or malignant, based on 9 different features.
- Explore deeply how back-propagation and gradient descent work.
- Review the basics and explore advanced concepts. 

**The data comes from The Wisconsin Cancer Data-set.**<br>
This data was gathered by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison and by Dr. William H. Wolberg.<br>
**By request of the owners of the data**: we mention one of the studies linked to the data-set: O. L. Mangasarian and W. H. Wolberg: "Cancer diagnosis via linear programming", SIAM News, Volume 23, Number 5, September 1990, pp 1 & 18.
