# Convolutional layer hacking with Python and numpy

Create a convolutional layer from scratch in python, hack its weights with custom kernels, and verify that its results match what pytorch produces.

**With this code and the associated article, you are going to:**

- Code from scratch in python a convolutional layer to understand bit by bit what is going on when we pass data through one of these layers.
- Hack the parameters of the convnet to produce a mix of custom kernels and random ones.
- Compare the results using Pytorch and Python-numpy to verify that we obtain exactly the same outputs. Ready? Let's do it.
